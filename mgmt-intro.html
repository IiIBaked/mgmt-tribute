    <h2 id="headline">Let's explore MGMT's releases, starting with the most recent:</h2>
   <ul>
       <li><strong>2018</strong>Little Dark Age</li>
        <li>The fourth album is a tapestry of gut feelings. Inadequacy, fear, depression, friendship, 
            love, leaps of faith, rage, and compassion are all intertwined with messages of rejecting
            what's programmed into us, taking political power back from the establishment, and seizing the
            day even in the face of suicide</li>
        <li><strong>2013</strong>MGMT</li>
        <li>This album was long-awaited and I bought it on CD as soon as it came out. I have to admit, 
            I found it disappointing at first. I didn't really "get" this album until about 2019 and
            now I love it, and loop it in my car as much as the others. This self-titled album was quite
            different from its predecessors, with one big punch of heavy beats in the first track and 
            no thought of a radio-style hit for the rest of the record. But what's in there is a heartfelt 
            journey back to the most important things in life, such as real friends instead of fame and 
            adulation</li>
        <li><strong>2011</strong>LateNightTales</li>
        <li>I have yet to listen to this release and therefore have no business reviewing it</li>
