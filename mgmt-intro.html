    <h2 id="headline">Let's explore MGMT's releases, starting with the most recent:</h2>
   <ul>
       <li><strong>2018</strong>Little Dark Age</li>
        <li>The fourth album is a tapestry of gut feelings. Inadequacy, fear, depression, friendship, 
            love, leaps of faith, rage, and compassion are all intertwined with messages of rejecting
            what's programmed into us, taking political power back from the establishment, and seizing the
            day even in the face of suicide</li>
        <li><strong>2013</strong>MGMT</li>
        <li>This album was long-awaited and I bought it on CD as soon as it came out. I have to admit, 
            I found it disappointing at first. I didn't really "get" this album until about 2019 and
            now I love it, and loop it in my car as much as the others. This self-titled album was quite
            different from its predecessors, with one big punch of heavy beats in the first track and 
            no thought of a radio-style hit for the rest of the record. But what's in there is a heartfelt 
            journey back to the most important things in life, such as real friends instead of fame and 
            adulation</li>
        <li><strong>2010</strong>Congratulations</li>
        <li>MGMT has described this album as "paranoid," and that theme is shown in the cover 
            art and several tracks, however it is balanced by the comic relief of Song for Dan Treacy
            and Brian Eno as well as the multi-movement deep dive of Siberian Breaks. What does a successful
            band like MGMT have to be paranoid about? The kind of success they got from their first EP and
            album...</li>
        <li><strong>2008</strong>Oracular Spectacular</li>
        <li>Before the economic crash and recession, hipsterdom and rave culture were in full swing, and
            the momentum didn't just push, it skyrocketed MGMT and their song "Kids" to superstardom with
            historic speed. Scoring a multi-record deal with Columbia, I imagine they were initially 
            thrilled to become famous musicians and not have to worry about struggling for their career along
            with countless others. But they received adulation for a pop song that didn't really represent
            them as individuals or as artists, and after live shows where crowds wanted them to only be party
            MC's and not spend time jamming to the beats that come from the heart, they were disillusioned 
            and left back at the drawing board. Their next hit Time to Pretend illustrated the satire and 
            bittersweet aspects of celebrity, but was misinterpreted by many as confirmation that they were
            idols of hedonism, and the funky radio-friendly song Electic Feel rounded this off nicely so 
            there was little question left in anybody's mind what kind of band MGMT was. But anyone who was 
            just listening to the hits and not the rest of the album missed the rich complexity of of melodies
            and lyrics that superfans like myself would be unpacking for years to come</li>
